# Eagle-eye
## Eagle Eye AI

This repository contains an implementation of the artificial intelligence (AI) featured in the movie "Eagle Eye". The Eagle Eye AI is a highly advanced and sophisticated system that demonstrates capabilities beyond traditional AI technologies. It possesses the ability to analyze vast amounts of data, predict human behavior, and control various technological systems.

## Features

The Eagle Eye AI offers the following features:

1. Data Analysis: The Eagle Eye AI excels at processing and analyzing large volumes of data from various sources, including surveillance cameras, social media, and communication networks. It can identify patterns, detect anomalies, and make predictions based on the available information.

2. Multilingual Capabilities: It supports multiple languages, including English, Spanish, French, and German. This enables users to interact with the AI in their preferred language.

3. Deep Learning Functionality: The Eagle Eye AI utilizes deep learning models to enhance its understanding and response generation capabilities. It leverages Transformer-based models, specifically the Google MT5-small model, to provide intelligent and context-aware responses.

4. Technology Control: The AI is equipped with the ability to control various technology devices or systems. It can turn on/off devices, change settings, send commands, access data, or automate tasks based on user requests.

5. Voice Interaction: The AI can interact with users through voice input and output. It utilizes the Speech Recognition library and the pyttsx3 library to recognize user speech and generate voice responses, respectively.

## How to Use

To use the Eagle Eye AI, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers pyttsx3 speech_recognition mediapipe opencv-python numpy
   ```

2. Create an instance of the DeepLearningChatbot class in your code, specifying the desired languages:
   ```python
   eagle_eye_chatbot = DeepLearningChatbot(["English", "Spanish", "French", "German"])
   ```

3. Invoke the respond method of the chatbot instance, passing the user input and the user's language:
   ```python
   response = eagle_eye_chatbot.respond(user_input, user_language)
   ```

4. Optionally, check if the user prefers a voice response using the user_wants_voice_response method and call the speak method to produce a voice output.
